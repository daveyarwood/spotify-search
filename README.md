# spotify-search

I'm migrating away from having a huge mp3 library toward listening to most
things on Spotify and just having a small collection of mp3s for artists/albums
that aren't available on Spotify.

To get there, I need to use the Spotify API to compile a list of albums I have
that aren't on Spotify.
